# Power-Bot
PowerBot is a multipurpose discord bot made using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/). 
Power Bot is now officially public! :)

# Self Hosting PowerBot
You can host PowerBot on a raspberry pi, or web hosting services like AWS or Heroku. For this guide, I am only going to go over hosting on a raspberry pi/computer.

  * __**Prerequisites:**__
    * A computer that has command prompt, or terminal access.
    * A computer that has node installed on it, and the ability to install npm modules.
    * Know the basics of how to add a Discord Bot to servers, setup & get tokens, etc.
    
  * __**Instructions:**__
    * Download the PowerBot code from Github in a zip, and unzip it.
    * Then delete the node modules folder & the .vscode folder.
    * Head over to Discord's Developer Page [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) to register a bot. 
    * After registering a bot, grab the bot's token. This will be used in the next step when the config needs to be filled in. A Discord Bot token should look like this: `MzgxPDY2NDIyODIxODk3MTk0.DhPVkg.2uX5QRrHLNhfU-nDzjK_rgdOJe4`. (<------- This is not a real token.)
    * View config (example).json, then create a config.json with all the missing information filled in.
    * Make sure that the newly created config.json is in the folder where the config (example).json is.
    * Open up a command prompt or terminal, and go to the folder where all the files are (cd <file location>)
    * Then run the following commands:
    ``` 
    npm install // To install all required npm modules
    node . // Start the bot
    ```
    * For a more detailed installation guide, please refer to this video [here](https://youtu.be/3C0wdh4DdpU). I did not fully fill in all the parameters in the config (example).json, but for PowerBot to work correctly in the long run, you should fill all parameters in.
    * Next, use the Discord Permissions Calculator [here](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html#2146958591) to make your bot's invite link. The link provided already has the required permissions pre-checked. If you choose not to use the pre-checked link, the bot must have "ADMINISTRATOR" permissions to function. At the bottom of the page, place in your bot's client ID, which is found on your Discord Developers page.
    * Then, copy the link at the bottom of the page. That is your bot's invite link, anyone who has that link and have the "Manage Server" permission or is the server owner of a server can invite your bot to their server. 
    * To invite the bot to a server, paste the link into your browser, and select the server that you want to add the bot to. Make sure all the required permissions are checked and click "Authorize".
    * You are all set, head to your server and check the bot out!

# Adding PowerBot To Your Discord Server
You can also just add PowerBot to your existing server. PowerBot has been already hosted for you in this option.

  * __**Prerequisites:**__
    * You need to have the "Manage Server" permission of the server __**OR**__ Be the owner of the server.
    * When adding PowerBot, make sure that the bot has "ADMINISTRATOR" permissions on your server.
    * A link is provided [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=460610749283172353&scope=bot&permissions=2146958591) with all of the required permissions pre-selected.
   
  * __**Basic Operations Guide**__
    * The prefix of PowerBot is `-`.
    * For general help, the support server & additional notes type `-help`.
    * For the full commands list, type `-commands`.
    * Each command is called using the prefix, in the following form: `-<command>` where <command> is the command. For example, to call the command ping, you would type `-ping`.
    * To check if PowerBot has the correct permissions, just type `-checklist`. If `PowerBot ADMINISTRATOR Permissions:` says `true` then PowerBot has the required permissions to function.
    * Feel free to join [this support server](https://discord.gg/KSjW2wB) if additional help is needed!
